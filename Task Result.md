# Task Result

## Used Technologies / Frameworks
* Python
* VS Code
* Jupyter Notebook with pandas

I chose Python as my programming language because it interested me the most and it felt like a good starting point for someone with zero experience.

I chose Jupyter Notebook in tandem with pandas to import the enclosed CSV File and to get a tabular representation of the data in the following way: 

import pandas as pd ; pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UDG-United-Digital-Group/frontend-junior-code-challenge-1/master/Artikel.csv", delimiter=";")

I had issues in the beginning because I didn't know about differentiating the various delimiters but I eventually figured it out.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries
I used the following 3rd party libraries in my project:

EditCSV - For a tabular representation of CSV Files in VS Code

matplotlib - For percentage representation of data records as a pie and bar chart

## Installation / Run
The following components must be installed locally:

* matplotlib

The PieChart.py python program can be run in any text editor I used VS Code
