#Task Result

##Used Technologies / Frameworks
- Python
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook with pandas
I chose Python as my programming language because it felt the most intuitive and like a good starting point for someone with zero experience.
I chose Jupyter Notebook in tandem with pandas to import the closed CSV File and to get a tabular representation of the data in the following way: 
import pandas as pd ; pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UDG-United-Digital-Group/frontend-junior-code-challenge-1/master/Artikel.csv", delimiter=";")
I had issues in the beginning because I didn't know about differentiating the various delimiters but I eventually figured it out.

##Used 3rd Party Libraries
I used the following 3rd party libraries in my project:
EditCSV - For a tabular representation of CSV Files in VS Code
matplotlib - For percentage representation of data records as a pie and bar chart

##Installation / Run
The following components must be installed locally:
-matplotlib

To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash
