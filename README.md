# FrontendChallenge-UDG-1

This is my attempt at the given task, I will keep working on it as I still see many ways to improve it

My goal was to understand the UDG Challenge since all the technical terms were new to me and that made them quite intimidating. I learned a lot through this experience and I had a lot of fun, thanks to Mr. Breit

My next goal is to do the remaining challanges and then start learning all about HTML and CSS to get a grasp of responsive web design, after that I want to focus on JavaScript and Python and gain basic knowledge in both languages before August.
