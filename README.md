# FrontendChallenge-UDG-1

This is my attempt at the CSV File challenge, I will keep working on it as I still see many ways to improve on the existing data and expand into more complex CSV Files.

My goal was to understand the UDG Challenge since all the technical terms were new to me and that made them quite intimidating. I learned a lot through this experience and I had a lot of fun, thanks to Mr. Breit

My next goal is to do the remaining challanges and then start learning all about HTML and CSS to get a grasp of responsive web design, after that I want to focus on JavaScript and Python and gain basic knowledge in both languages before August.
